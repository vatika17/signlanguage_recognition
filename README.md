# signlanguage_recognition
American sign Language, is a natural language that serves as the predominant sign language of Deaf communities. But, deaf people often have difficulties talking to abled people because not everyone can remember all the alphabets of sign langauge. So, we need a model which can detect hand postures fron real-time video and show the alphabet associated with it.<br>
This model can detect all the ASL alphabets ranging from A to Z (excluding J and Z).
The dataset is made manually by running the __*Image Collection python file*__ that collects images from your webcam for all the mentioned above alphabets in the American Sign Language :<br>
